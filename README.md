# IITD UVD Robot

The UVD robot is a fully autonomous, smart device that has the potential to allow people to return to their pre-Covid lifestyle. It leverages the germicidal properties of UV-C to destroy all kinds of bacteria and viruses thereby disinfecting surfaces. Our robot is built around the needs of both small and large scale organisations. The initial setup requires the robot to be simply driven around the building. Once that is done, the user has the ability to create multiple missions by simply choosing various locations in the building. These missions, that can be run on the touch of a button, will make the robot travel to all the locations and sanitise autonomously. For making this process simple and user intuitive, we have created our very own android application. This app not only helps you setup the robot, drive it and create missions but also allows you to keep a track of the robotâ€™s health, reports of previous missions and shall allow software updates in the future. Built using cutting edge technology, this robot is the perfect response for Corona Virus that you are looking for!
